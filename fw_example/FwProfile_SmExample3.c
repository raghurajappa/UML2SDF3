/**
 * State Machine Example for C1 Implementation of the FW Profile.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the extension process for state machines.
 * First, a base state machine is created and configured and then
 * a second state machine is derived from the first one.
 * The derived state machine overrides one action of its base state
 * machine but is otherwise a clone of its base. A diagram of the two
 * state machines and a description of this example can be found here:
 * http://fwprofile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/SmExample3.png
 *
 * The base state machine has 2 states, no choice pseudo-state,
 * 3 transitions, 2 actions, and 1 guard. Its characteristics are:
 * - State S1 with one entry action Action1
 * - State S2 with one exit action Action2
 * - Transition from the Initial Pseudo-State (IPS) to S1
 * - Transition from S1 to S2 has trigger Trigger1 and guard Guard1
 * - Transition from S2 to S1 has trigger Trigger2
 * .
 * The derived state machine overrides the exit action of S2 with Action2_Der.
 *
 * The code in this file must be compiled and linked with the
 * code of the C1 Implementation available from here:
 * http://code.google.com/p/fwprofile/downloads/list
