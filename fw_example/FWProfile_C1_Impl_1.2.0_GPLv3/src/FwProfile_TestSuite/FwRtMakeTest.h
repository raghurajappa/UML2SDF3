 * - The outcome of the actions in the container procedures is determined by
 *   the flags in the <code>::TestRtData</code> data structure.
 * - Default values are used for the Activation Thread, mutex and condition
 *   variable attributes.

 * - Each action in one of the container procedures increments the associated

 * - The Execute Functional Behaviour action, in addition to incrementing a
 *   counter, also waits 1 millisecond before returning.
 * - The outcome of the actions in the container procedures is determined by
 *   the flags in the <code>::TestRtData</code> data structure.
 * - Default values are used for the Activation Thread, mutex and condition
 *   variable attributes.
 * .
 * The wait in the functional behaviour action is useful to simulate the case
 * of a container with a "long" execution time potentially giving rise to
 * an accumulation of unhandled notification requests.
 *
 * This function returns the RT Container with its counters set to zero and its
 * flags set to false.
