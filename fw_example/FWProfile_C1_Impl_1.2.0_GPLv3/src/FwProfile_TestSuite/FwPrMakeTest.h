 * The counters are incremented by the procedure actions and the flags are used to
 * determine the outcome of the procedure guards.
 * 
 * The actions attached to the test procedures write a "marker" and the current node of
 * their procedure to two log arrays (<code>logMarker</code> and <code>logNode</code>, these
 * arrays are defined as global variables in the c-file). The value of the marker is stored
 * in field <code>marker</code>.
 * Thus, when a procedure action is executed it does the following:
 * -# it writes the marker at <code>logMarker[logIndex]</code>;
 * -# it writes the current node identifier at <code>logNode[logIndex]</code>; and
 * -# it increments <code>logIndex</code> by 1.
