 * This data structure defines <i>counters</i> and <i>flags</i>.

 * 
 * The actions attached to the test state machines write a "marker" and the current state of
 * their state machine to two log arrays (<code>logMarker</code> and <code>logState</code>).
 * 
 * Thus, when a state action is executed it does the following:
 * -# it writes: <code>(marker+logBase)</code> at <code>logMarker[logIndex]</code>;
 * -# it writes: <code>(currentState+logBase)</code> at <code>logState[logIndex]</code>; and
 * -# it increments <code>logIndex</code> by 1.
 * 
 * The values of the markers are: 1 for the entry action; 2 for the do-action; 3 for the exit
 * action; and 4 for the transition action.
 * 
 * The log arrays are common to all test state machines. In order to allow the entries made
 * by different state machines to be distinguished, the <code>logBase</code> field provides
 * an offset which is specific to each state machine.
