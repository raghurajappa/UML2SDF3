/**
 * State Machine Example for C1 Implementation of the FW Profile.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the creation, configuration and use of
 * a state machine with another state machine embedded in one of its
 * states. A diagram of the example state machine can be found here:
 * http://fwprofile.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/SmExample2.png
 *
 * The outer state machine has 2 states, 1 choice pseudo-state,
 * 5 transitions, 4 actions, and 2 guards. Its characteristics are:
 * - State S1 with one exit action Action2
 * - State S2 with one entry action Action4 and one do-Action Action3
 *   and a state machine embedded within it
 * - Transition from the Initial Pseudo-State (IPS) to S1 has a
 *   transition action Action1
 * - Transition from S1 to CPS1 has trigger Trigger1
 * - Transition from CPS1 to S1 has guard Guard1
 * - Transition from CPS2 to S2 has guard Guard2
 * - Transition from S2 to the Final Pseudo-State has trigger Trigger2,
 *   guard Guard2 and transition action Action2
 * .
 *
 * The embedded state machine is embedded in state S2. It has 2
 * states, 2 transitions, 2 actions and 1 guard. Its characteristics are:
 * - State ES1 with one entry action Action5
 * - Transition from the Initial Pseudo-State (IPS) to ES1 has no
 *   transition action
 * - Transition from ES1 to ES2 has trigger Trigger3
 * - State ES2 with one entry action Action6.
 * - There is no final pseudo-state
 * .
 * The code in this file must be compiled and linked with the
 * code of the C1 Implementation available from here:
